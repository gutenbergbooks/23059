      MY FRIEND THE MURDERER

    <h2>
      By A. Conan Doyle
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number 481 is no better, doctor,&rdquo; said the head-warder, in a slightly
      reproachful accent, looking in round the corner of my door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound 481&rdquo; I responded from behind the pages of the <i>Australian
      Sketcher</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And 61 says his tubes are paining him. Couldn&rsquo;t you do anything for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a walking drug-shop,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He has the whole British pharmacopa√¶
      inside him. I believe his tubes are as sound as yours are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s 7 and 108, they are chronic,&rdquo; continued the warder, glancing
      down a blue slip of paper. &ldquo;And 28 knocked off work yesterday&mdash;said
      lifting things gave him a stitch in the side. I want you to have a look at
      him, if you don&rsquo;t mind, doctor. There&rsquo;s 81, too&mdash;him that killed John
      Adamson in the Corinthian brig&mdash;he&rsquo;s been carrying on awful in the
      night, shrieking and yelling, he has, and no stopping him either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll have a look at him afterward,&rdquo; I said, tossing my paper
      carelessly aside, and pouring myself out a cup of coffee. &ldquo;Nothing else to
      report, I suppose, warder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The official protruded his head a little further into the room. &ldquo;Beg
      pardon, doctor,&rdquo; he said, in a confidential tone, &ldquo;but I notice as 82 has
      a bit of a cold, and it would be a good excuse for you to visit him and
      have a chat, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cup of coffee was arrested half-way to my lips as I stared in
      amazement at the man&rsquo;s serious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excuse?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;An excuse? What the deuce are you talking about,
      McPherson? You see me trudging about all day at my practise, when I&rsquo;m not
      looking after the prisoners, and coming back every night as tired as a
      dog, and you talk about finding an excuse for doing more work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d like it, doctor,&rdquo; said Warder McPherson, insinuating one of his
      shoulders into the room. &ldquo;That man&rsquo;s story&rsquo;s worth listening to if you
      could get him to tell it, though he&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;d call free in his
      speech. Maybe you don&rsquo;t know who 82 is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t care either,&rdquo; I answered, in the conviction that
      some local ruffian was about to be foisted upon me as a celebrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Maloney,&rdquo; said the warder, &ldquo;him that turned Queen&rsquo;s evidence after
      the murders at Bluemansdyke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo; I ejaculated, laying down my cup in astonishment. I
      had heard of this ghastly series of murders, and read an account of them
      in a London magazine long before setting foot in the colony. I remembered
      that the atrocities committed had thrown the Burke and Hare crimes
      completely into the shade, and that one of the most villainous of the gang
      had saved his own skin by betraying his companions. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s him right enough. Just you draw him out a bit, and he&rsquo;ll
      astonish you. He&rsquo;s a man to know, is Maloney; that&rsquo;s to say, in
      moderation;&rdquo; and the head grinned, bobbed, and disappeared, leaving me to
      finish my breakfast and ruminate over what I had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeonship of an Australian prison is not an enviable position. It
      may be endurable in Melbourne or Sydney, but the little town of Perth has
      few attractions to recommend it, and those few had been long exhausted.
      The climate was detestable, and the society far from congenial. Sheep and
      cattle were the staple support of the community; and their prices,
      breeding, and diseases the principal topic of conversation. Now as I,
      being an outsider, possessed neither the one nor the other, and was
      utterly callous to the new &ldquo;dip&rdquo; and the &ldquo;rot&rdquo; and other kindred topics, I
      found myself in a state of mental isolation, and was ready to hail
      anything which might relieve the monotony of my existence. Maloney, the
      murderer, had at least some distinctiveness and individuality in his
      character, and might act as a tonic to a mind sick of the commonplaces of
      existence. I determined that I should follow the warder&rsquo;s advice, and take
      the excuse for making his acquaintance. When, therefore, I went upon my
      usual matutinal round, I turned the lock of the door which bore the
      convict&rsquo;s number upon it, and walked into the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was lying in a heap upon his rough bed as I entered, but,
      uncoiling his long limbs, he started up and stared at me with an insolent
      look of defiance on his face which augured badly for our interview. He had
      a pale, set face, with sandy hair and a steely-blue eye, with something
      feline in its expression. His frame was tall and muscular, though there
      was a curious bend in his shoulders, which almost amounted to a deformity.
      An ordinary observer meeting him in the street might have put him down as
      a well-developed man, fairly handsome, and of studious habits&mdash;even
      in the hideous uniform of the rottenest convict establishment he imparted
      a certain refinement to his carriage which marked him out among the
      inferior ruffians around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not on the sick-list,&rdquo; he said, gruffly. There was something in the
      hard, rasping voice which dispelled all softer illusions, and made me
      realize that I was face to face with the man of the Lena Valley and
      Bluemansdyke, the bloodiest bushranger that ever stuck up a farm or cut
      the throats of its occupants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Warder McPherson told me you had a cold,
      though, and I thought I&rsquo;d look in and see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast Warder McPherson, and blast you, too!&rdquo; yelled the convict, in a
      paroxysm of rage. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he added in a quieter voice; &ldquo;hurry
      away; report me to the governor, do! Get me another six months or so&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      your game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to report you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight square feet of ground,&rdquo; he went on, disregarding my protest, and
      evidently working himself into a fury again. &ldquo;Eight square feet, and I
      can&rsquo;t have that without being talked to and stared at, and&mdash;oh, blast
      the whole crew of you!&rdquo; and he raised his two clinched hands above, his
      head and shook them in passionate invective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a curious idea of hospitality,&rdquo; I remarked, determined not to
      lose my temper, and saying almost the first thing that came to my tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise the words had an extraordinary effect upon him. He seemed
      completely staggered at my assuming the proposition for which he had been
      so fiercely contending&mdash;namely, that the room in which he stood was
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be rude. Won&rsquo;t you take a
      seat?&rdquo; and he motioned toward a rough trestle, which formed the head-piece
      of his couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down, rather astonished at the sudden change. I don&rsquo;t know that I
      liked Maloney better under this new aspect. The murderer had, it is true,
      disappeared for the nonce, but there was something in the smooth tones and
      obsequious manner which powerfully suggested the witness of the queen, who
      had stood up and sworn away the lives of his companions in crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your chest?&rdquo; I asked, putting on my professional air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, drop it, doctor&mdash;drop it!&rdquo; he answered, showing a row of white
      teeth as he resumed his seat upon the side of the bed. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t anxiety
      after my precious health that brought you along here; that story won&rsquo;t
      wash at all. You came to have a look at Wolf Tone Maloney, forger,
      murderer, Sydney-slider, ranger, and government peach. That&rsquo;s about my
      figure, ain&rsquo;t it? There it is, plain and straight; there&rsquo;s nothing mean
      about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused as if he expected me to say something; but as I remained silent,
      he repeated once or twice, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing mean about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he suddenly yelled, his eyes gleaming and his whole
      satanic nature reasserting itself. &ldquo;We were bound to swing, one and all,
      and they were none the worse if I saved myself by turning against them.
      Every man for himself, say I, and the devil take the luckiest. You haven&rsquo;t
      a plug of tobacco, doctor, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tore at the piece of &ldquo;Barrett&rsquo;s&rdquo; which I handed him, as ravenously as a
      wild beast. It seemed to have the effect of soothing his nerves, for he
      settled himself down in the bed and re-assumed his former deprecating
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like it yourself, you know, doctor,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s enough
      to make any man a little queer in his temper. I&rsquo;m in for six months this
      time for assault, and very sorry I shall be to go out again, I can tell
      you. My mind&rsquo;s at ease in here; but when I&rsquo;m outside, what with the
      government and what with Tattooed Tom, of Hawkesbury, there&rsquo;s no chance of
      a quiet life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the brother of John Grimthorpe, the same that was condemned on my
      evidence; and an infernal scamp he was, too! Spawn of the devil, both of
      them! This tattooed one is a murderous ruffian, and he swore to have my
      blood after that trial. It&rsquo;s seven year ago, and he&rsquo;s following me yet; I
      know he is, though he lies low and keeps dark. He came up to me in
      Ballarat in &lsquo;75; you can see on the back of my hand here where the bullet
      clipped me. He tried again in &lsquo;76, at Port Philip, but I got the drop on
      him and wounded him badly. He knifed me in &lsquo;79, though, in a bar at
      Adelaide, and that made our account about level. He&rsquo;s loafing round again
      now, and he&rsquo;ll let daylight into me&mdash;unless&mdash;unless by some
      extraordinary chance some one does as much for him.&rdquo; And Maloney gave a
      very ugly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t complain of <i>him</i> so much,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Looking at it in
      his way, no doubt it is a sort of family matter that can hardly be
      neglected. It&rsquo;s the government that fetches me. When I think of what I&rsquo;ve
      done for this country, and then of what this country has done for me, it
      makes me fairly wild&mdash;clean drives me off my head. There&rsquo;s no
      gratitude nor common decency left, doctor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He brooded over his wrongs for a few minutes, and then proceeded to lay
      them before me in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s nine men,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve been murdering and killing for a
      matter of three years, and maybe a life a week wouldn&rsquo;t more than average
      the work that they&rsquo;ve done. The government catches them and the government
      tries them, but they can&rsquo;t convict; and why?&mdash;because the witnesses
      have all had their throats cut, and the whole job&rsquo;s been very neatly done.
      What happens then? Up comes a citizen called Wolf Tone Maloney; he says,
      &lsquo;The country needs me, and here I am.&rsquo; And with that he gives his
      evidence, convicts the lot, and enables the beaks to hang them. That&rsquo;s
      what I did. There&rsquo;s nothing mean about me! And now what does the country
      do in return? Dogs me, sir, spies on me, watches me night and day, turns
      against the very man that worked so very hard for it. There&rsquo;s something
      mean about that, anyway. I didn&rsquo;t expect them to knight me, nor to make me
      colonial secretary; but, damn it! I did expect that they would let me
      alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I remonstrated, &ldquo;if you choose to break laws and assault people,
      you can&rsquo;t expect it to be looked over on account of former services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t refer to my present imprisonment, sir,&rdquo; said Maloney, with
      dignity. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the life I&rsquo;ve been leading since that cursed trial that
      takes the soul out of me. Just you sit there on that trestle, and I&rsquo;ll
      tell you all about it, and then look me in the face and tell me that I&rsquo;ve
      been treated fair by the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shall endeavor to transcribe the experience of the convict in his own
      words, as far as I can remember them, preserving his curious perversions
      of right and wrong. I can answer for the truth of his facts, whatever may
      be said for his deductions from them. Months afterward, Inspector H. W.
      Hann, formerly governor of the jail at Dunedin, showed me entries in his
      ledger which corroborated every statement Maloney reeled the story off in
      a dull, monotonous voice, with his head sunk upon his breast and his hands
      between his knees. The glitter of his serpentlike eyes was the only sign
      of the emotions which were stirred up by the recollection of the events
      which he narrated.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      You&rsquo;ve read of Bluemansdyke (he began, with some pride in his tone). We
      made it hot while it lasted; but they ran us to earth at last, and a trap
      called Braxton, with a damned Yankee, took the lot of us. That was in New
      Zealand, of course, and they took us down to Dunedin, and there they were
      convicted and hanged. One and all they put up their hands in the dock, and
      cursed me till your blood would have run cold to hear them&mdash;which was
      scurvy treatment, seeing that we had all been pals together; but they were
      a blackguard lot, and thought only of themselves. I think it is as well
      that they were hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took me back to Dunedin Jail, and clapped me into the old cell. The
      only difference they made was, that I had no work to do and was well fed.
      I stood this for a week or two, until one day the governor was making his
      rounds, and I put the matter to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;My conditions were a free pardon, and you&rsquo;re
      keeping me here against the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a sort of a smile. &ldquo;Should you like very much to get out?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that unless you open that door I&rsquo;ll have an action
      against you for illegal detention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed a bit astonished by my resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very anxious to meet your death,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, and you&rsquo;ll know what I mean,&rdquo; he answered. And he led me down
      the passage to a window that overlooked the door of the prison. &ldquo;Look at
      that!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked out, and there were a dozen or so rough-looking fellows standing
      outside the street, some of them smoking, some playing cards on the
      pavement. When they saw me they gave a yell and crowded round the door,
      shaking their fists and hooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wait for you, watch and watch about,&rdquo; said the governor. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      the executive of the vigilance committee. However, since you are
      determined to go, I can&rsquo;t stop you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye call this a civilized land,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and let a man be murdered in
      cold blood in open daylight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I said this the governor and the warder and every fool in the place
      grinned, as if a man&rsquo;s life was a rare good joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the law on your side,&rdquo; says the governor; &ldquo;so we won&rsquo;t detain
      you any longer. Show him out, warder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He&rsquo;d have done it, too, the black-hearted villain, if I hadn&rsquo;t begged and
      prayed and offered to pay for my board and lodging, which is more than any
      prisoner ever did before me. He let me stay on those conditions; and for
      three months I was caged up there with every larrikin in the township
      clamoring at the other side of the wall. That was pretty treatment for a
      man that had served his country!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, one morning up came the governor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Maloney,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how long are you going to honor us with your
      society?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could have put a knife into his cursed body, and would, too, if we had
      been alone in the bush; but I had to smile, and smooth him and flatter,
      for I feared that he might have me sent out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an infernal rascal,&rdquo; he said; those were his very words, to a man
      that had helped him all he knew how. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any rough justice here,
      though; and I think I see my way to getting you out of Dunedin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget you, governor,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and, by God! I never will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your thanks nor your gratitude,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not for
      your sake that I do it, but simply to keep order in the town. There&rsquo;s a
      steamer starts from the West Quay to Melbourne to-morrow, and we&rsquo;ll get
      you aboard it. She is advertised at five in the morning, so have yourself
      in readiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I packed up the few things I had, and was smuggled out by a back door,
      just before daybreak. I hurried down, took my ticket under the name of
      Isaac Smith, and got safely aboard the Melbourne boat. I remember hearing
      her screw grinding into the water as the warps were cast loose, and
      looking back at the lights of Dunedin as I leaned upon the bulwarks, with
      the pleasant thought that I was leaving them behind me forever. It seemed
      to me that a new world was before me, and that all my troubles had been
      cast off. I went down below and had some coffee, and came up again feeling
      better than I had done since the morning that I woke to find that cursed
      Irishman that took me standing over me with a six-shooter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day had dawned by that time, and we were steaming along by the coast, well
      out of sight of Dunedin. I loafed about for a couple of hours, and when
      the sun got well up some of the other passengers came on deck and joined
      me. One of them, a little perky sort of fellow, took a good long look at
      me, and then came over and began talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mining, I suppose?&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made your pile?&rdquo; he asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty fair,&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at it myself,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I worked at the Nelson fields for three
      months, and spent all I made in buying a salted claim which busted up the
      second day. I went at it again, though, and struck it rich; but when the
      gold wagon was going down to the settlements, it was stuck up by those
      cursed rangers, and not a red cent left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a bad job,&rdquo; I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broke me&mdash;ruined me clean. Never mind, I&rsquo;ve seen them all hanged for
      it; that makes it easier to bear. There&rsquo;s only one left&mdash;the villain
      that gave the evidence. I&rsquo;d die happy if I could come across him. There
      are two things I have to do if I meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; says I, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to ask him where the money lies&mdash;they never had time to
      make away with it, and it&rsquo;s <i>cach√©d</i> somewhere in the mountains&mdash;and
      then I&rsquo;ve got to stretch his neck for him, and send his soul down to join
      the men that he betrayed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that I knew something about that <i>cach√©</i>, and I felt
      like laughing; but he was watching me, and it struck me that he had a
      nasty, vindictive kind of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up on the bridge,&rdquo; I said, for he was not a man whose
      acquaintance I cared much about making.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wouldn&rsquo;t hear of my leaving him, though. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both miners,&rdquo; he says,
      &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re pals for the voyage. Come down to the bar. I&rsquo;m not too poor to
      shout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t refuse him well, and we went down together; and that was the
      beginning of the trouble. What harm was I doing any one on the ship? All I
      asked for was a quiet life, leaving others alone and getting left alone
      myself. No man could ask fairer than that. And now just you listen to what
      came of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were passing the front of the ladies&rsquo; cabin, on our way to the saloon,
      when out comes a servant lass&mdash;a freckled currency she-devil&mdash;with
      a baby in her arms. We were brushing past her, when she gave a scream like
      a railway whistle, and nearly dropped the kid. My nerves gave a sort of a
      jump when I heard that scream, but I turned and begged her pardon, letting
      on that I thought I might have trod on her foot. I knew the game was up,
      though, when I saw her white face, and her leaning against the door and
      pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s him! I saw him in the court-house. Oh, don&rsquo;t
      let him hurt the baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked the steward and half a dozen others in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him&mdash;Maloney&mdash;Maloney, the murderer&mdash;oh, take him
      away&mdash;take him away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t rightly remember what happened just at that moment. The furniture
      and me seemed to get kind of mixed, and there was cursing, and smashing,
      and some one shouting for his gold, and a general stamping round. When I
      got steadied a bit, I found somebody&rsquo;s hand in my mouth. From what I
      gathered afterward, I concluded that it belonged to that same little man
      with the vicious way of talking. He got some of it out again, but that was
      because the others were choking me. A poor chap can get no fair play in
      this world when once he is down&mdash;still, I think he will remember me
      till the day of his death&mdash;longer, I hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dragged me out on to the poop and held a damned court-martial&mdash;on
      <i>me</i>, mind you; <i>me</i>, that had thrown over my pals in order to
      serve them. What were they to do with me? Some said this, some said that;
      but it ended by the captain deciding to send me ashore. The ship stopped,
      they lowered a boat, and I was hoisted in, the whole gang of them hooting
      at me from over the bulwarks, I saw the man I spoke of tying up his hand,
      though, and I felt that things might be worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I changed my opinion before we got to the land. I had reckoned on the
      shore being deserted, and that I might make my way inland; but the ship
      had stopped too near the Heads, and a dozen beach-combers and such like
      had come down to the water&rsquo;s edge and were staring at us, wondering what
      the boat was after. When we got to the edge of the surf the cockswain
      hailed them, and after singing out who I was, he and his men threw me into
      the water. You may well look surprised&mdash;neck and crop into ten feet
      of water, with sharks as thick as green parrots in the bush, and I heard
      them laughing as I floundered to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon saw it was a worse job than ever. As I came scrambling out through
      the weeds, I was collared by a big chap with a velveteen coat, and half a
      dozen others got round me and held me fast. Most of them looked simple
      fellows enough, and I was not afraid of them; but there was one in a
      cabbage-tree hat that had a very nasty expression on his face, and the big
      man seemed to be chummy with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dragged me up the beach, and then they let go their hold of me and
      stood round in a circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mate,&rdquo; says the man with the hat, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been looking out for you
      some time in these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And very good of you, too,&rdquo; I answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your jaw,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Come, boys, what shall it be&mdash;hanging,
      drowning, or shooting? Look sharp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This looked a bit too like business. &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
      government protection, and it&rsquo;ll be murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call it,&rdquo; answered the one in the velveteen coat, as
      cheery as a piping crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to murder me for being a ranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ranger be damned!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to hang you for peaching
      against your pals; and that&rsquo;s an end of the palaver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They slung a rope round my neck and dragged me up to the edge of the bush.
      There were some big she-oaks and blue-gums, and they pitched on one of
      these for the wicked deed. They ran the rope over a branch, tied my hands,
      and told me to say my prayers. It seemed as if it was all up; but
      Providence interfered to save me. It sounds nice enough sitting here and
      telling about it, sir; but it was sick work to stand with nothing but the
      beach in front of you, and the long white line of surf, with the steamer
      in the distance, and a set of bloody-minded villains round you thirsting
      for your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never thought I&rsquo;d owe anything good to the police; but they saved me
      that time. A troop of them were riding from Hawkes Point Station to
      Dunedin, and hearing that something was up, they came down through the
      bush and interrupted the proceedings. I&rsquo;ve heard some bands in my time,
      doctor, but I never heard music like the jingle of those traps&rsquo; spurs and
      harness as they galloped out on to the open. They tried to hang me even
      then, but the police were too quick for them; and the man with the hat got
      one over the head with the flat of a sword. I was clapped on to a horse,
      and before evening I found myself in my old quarters in the city jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor wasn&rsquo;t to be done, though. He was determined to get rid of
      me, and I was equally anxious to see the last of him. He waited a week or
      so until the excitement had begun to die away, and then he smuggled me
      aboard a three-masted schooner bound to Sydney with tallow and hides.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got far away to sea without a hitch, and things began to look a bit
      more rosy. I made sure that I had seen the last of the prison, anyway. The
      crew had a sort of an idea who I was, and if there&rsquo;d been any rough
      weather, they&rsquo;d have hove me overboard, like enough; for they were a
      rough, ignorant lot, and had a notion that I brought bad luck to the ship.
      We had a good passage, however, and I was landed safe and sound upon
      Sydney Quay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now just you listen to what happened next. You&rsquo;d have thought they would
      have been sick of ill-using me and following me by this time&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
      you, now? Well, just you listen. It seems that a cursed steamer started
      from Dunedin to Sydney on the very day we left, and got in before us,
      bringing news that I was coming. Blessed if they hadn&rsquo;t called a meeting&mdash;a
      regular mass-meeting&mdash;at the docks to discuss about it, and I marched
      right into it when I landed. They didn&rsquo;t take long about arresting me, and
      I listened to all the speeches and resolutions. If I&rsquo;d been a prince there
      couldn&rsquo;t have been more excitement. The end of all was that they agreed
      that it wasn&rsquo;t right that New Zealand should be allowed to foist her
      criminals upon her neighbors, and that I was to be sent back again by the
      next boat. So they posted me off again as if I was a damned parcel; and
      after another eight-hundred-mile journey I found myself back for the third
      time moving in the place that I started from.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time I had begun to think that I was going to spend the rest of my
      existence traveling about from one port to another. Every man&rsquo;s hand
      seemed turned against me, and there was no peace or quiet in any
      direction. I was about sick of it by the time I had come back; and if I
      could have taken to the bush I&rsquo;d have done it, and chanced it with my old
      pals. They were too quick for me, though, and kept me under lock and key;
      but I managed, in spite of them, to negotiate that <i>cach√©</i> I told you
      of, and sewed the gold up in my belt. I spent another month in jail, and
      then they slipped me aboard a bark that was bound for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the crew never knew who I was, but the captain had a pretty good
      idea, though he didn&rsquo;t let on to me that he had any suspicions. I guessed
      from the first that the man was a villain. We had a fair passage, except a
      gale or two off the Cape; and I began to feel like a free man when I saw
      the blue loom of the old country, and the saucy little pilot-boat from
      Falmouth dancing toward us over the waves. We ran down the Channel, and
      before we reached Gravesend I had agreed with the pilot that he should
      take me ashore with him when he left. It was at this time that the captain
      showed me that I was right in thinking him a meddling, disagreeable man. I
      got my things packed, such as they were, and left him talking earnestly to
      the pilot, while I went below for my breakfast. When I came up again we
      were fairly into the mouth of the river, and the boat in which I was to
      have gone ashore had left us. The skipper said the pilot had forgotten me;
      but that was too thin, and I began to fear that all my old troubles were
      going to commence once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before my suspicions were confirmed. A boat darted out
      from the side of the river, and a tall cove with a long black beard came
      aboard. I heard him ask the mate whether they didn&rsquo;t need a mud-pilot to
      take them up in the reaches, but it seemed to me that he was a man who
      would know a deal more about handcuffs than he did about steering, so I
      kept away from him. He came across the deck, however, and made some remark
      to me, taking a good look at me the while. I don&rsquo;t like inquisitive people
      at any time, but an inquisitive stranger with glue about the roots of his
      beard is the worst of all to stand, especially under the circumstances. I
      began to feel that it was time for me to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon got a chance, and made good use of it. A big collier came athwart
      the bows of our steamer, and we had to slacken down to dead slow. There
      was a barge astern, and I slipped down by a rope and was into the barge
      before any one missed me. Of course I had to leave my luggage behind me,
      but I had the belt with the nuggets round my waist, and the chance of
      shaking the police off my track was worth more than a couple of boxes. It
      was clear to me now that the pilot had been a traitor, as well as the
      captain, and had set the detectives after me. I often wish I could drop
      across those two men again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hung about the barge all day as she drifted down the stream. There was
      one man in her, but she was a big, ugly craft, and his hands were too full
      for much looking about. Toward evening, when it got a bit dusky, I struck
      out for the shore, and found myself in a sort of marsh place, a good many
      miles to the east of London. I was soaking wet and half dead with hunger,
      but I trudged into the town, got a new rig-out at a slop-shop, and after
      having some supper, engaged a bed at the quietest lodgings I could find.
    </p>
    <p>
      I woke pretty early&mdash;a habit you pick up in the bush&mdash;and lucky
      for me that I did so. The very first thing I saw when I took a look
      through a chink in the shutter was one of these infernal policemen
      standing right opposite and staring up at the windows. He hadn&rsquo;t epaulets
      nor a sword, like our traps, but for all that there was a sort of family
      likeness, and the same busybody expression. Whether they followed me all
      the time, or whether the woman that let me the bed didn&rsquo;t like the looks
      of me, is more than I have ever been able to find out. He came across as I
      was watching him, and noted down the address of the house in a book. I was
      afraid that he was going to ring at the bell, but I suppose his orders
      were simply to keep an eye on me, for after another good look at the
      windows he moved on down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that my only chance was to act at once. I threw on my clothes,
      opened the window softly, and, after making sure that there was nobody
      about, dropped out onto the ground and made off as hard as I could run. I
      traveled a matter of two or three miles, when my wind gave out; and as I
      saw a big building with people going in and out, I went in too, and found
      that it was a railway station. A train was just going off for Dover to
      meet the French boat, so I took a ticket and jumped into a third-class
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a couple of other chaps in the carriage, innocent-looking young
      beggars, both of them. They began speaking about this and that, while I
      sat quiet in the corner and listened. Then they started on England and
      foreign countries, and such like. Look ye now, doctor, this is a fact. One
      of them begins jawing about the justice of England&rsquo;s laws. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all fair
      and above-board,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t any secret police, nor spying,
      like they have abroad,&rdquo; and a lot more of the same sort of wash. Rather
      rough on me, wasn&rsquo;t it, listening to the damned young fool, with the
      police following me about like my shadow?
    </p>
    <p>
      I got to Paris right enough, and there I changed some of my gold, and for
      a few days I imagined I&rsquo;d shaken them off, and began to think of settling
      down for a bit of rest. I needed it by that time, for I was looking more
      like a ghost than a man. You&rsquo;ve never had the police after you, I suppose?
      Well, you needn&rsquo;t look offended, I didn&rsquo;t mean any harm. If ever you had
      you&rsquo;d know that it wastes a man away like a sheep with the rot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the opera one night and took a box, for I was very flush. I was
      coming out between the acts when I met a fellow lounging along in the
      passage. The light fell on his face, and I saw that it was the mud-pilot
      that had boarded us in the Thames. His beard was gone, but I recognized
      the man at a glance, for I&rsquo;ve a good memory for faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you, doctor, I felt desperate for a moment. I could have knifed him
      if we had been alone, but he knew me well enough never to give me the
      chance. It was more than I could stand any longer, so I went right up to
      him and drew him aside, where we&rsquo;d be free from all the loungers and
      theater-goers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long are you going to keep it up?&rdquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed a bit flustered for a moment, but then he saw there was no use
      beating about the bush, so he answered straight:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you go back to Australia,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I have served the government and got a
      free pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grinned all over his ugly face when I said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know all about you, Maloney,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If you want a quiet life,
      just you go back where you came from. If you stay here, you&rsquo;re a marked
      man; and when you are found tripping it&rsquo;ll be a lifer for you, at the
      least. Free trade&rsquo;s a fine thing but the market&rsquo;s too full of men like you
      for us to need to import any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that there was something in what he said, though he had a
      nasty way of putting it. For some days back I&rsquo;d been feeling a sort of
      homesick. The ways of the people weren&rsquo;t my ways. They stared at me in the
      street; and if I dropped into a bar, they&rsquo;d stop talking and edge away a
      bit, as if I was a wild beast. I&rsquo;d sooner have had a pint of old
      Stringybark, too, than a bucketful of their rot-gut liquors. There was too
      much damned propriety. What was the use of having money if you couldn&rsquo;t
      dress as you liked, nor bust in properly? There was no sympathy for a man
      if he shot about a little when he was half-over, I&rsquo;ve seen a man dropped
      at Nelson many a time with less row than they&rsquo;d make over a broken
      window-pane. The thing was slow, and I was sick of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to go back?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve my order to stick fast to you until you do,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I do. All I bargain is that you keep your
      mouth shut and don&rsquo;t let on who I am, so that I may have a fair start when
      I get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He agreed to this, and we went over to Southampton the very next day,
      where he saw me safely off once more. I took a passage round to Adelaide,
      where no one was likely to know me; and there I settled, right under the
      nose of the police. I&rsquo;d been there ever since, leading a quiet life, but
      for little difficulties like the one I&rsquo;m in for now, and for that devil,
      Tattooed Tom, of Hawkesbury. I don&rsquo;t know what made me tell you all this,
      doctor, unless it is that being lonely makes a man inclined to jaw when he
      gets a chance. Just you take warning from me, though. Never put yourself
      out to serve your country; for your country will do precious little for
      you. Just you let them look after their own affairs; and if they find
      difficulty in hanging a set of scoundrels, never mind chipping in, but let
      them alone to do as best they can. Maybe they&rsquo;ll remember how they treated
      me after I&rsquo;m dead, and be sorry for neglecting me, I was rude to you when
      you came in, and swore a trifle promiscuous: but don&rsquo;t you mind me, it&rsquo;s
      only my way. You&rsquo;ll allow, though, that I have cause to be a bit touchy
      now and again when I think of all that&rsquo;s passed. You&rsquo;re not going, are
      you? Well, if you must, you must; but I hope you will look me up at odd
      times when you are going your rounds. Oh, I say, you&rsquo;ve left the balance
      of that cake of tobacco behind you, haven&rsquo;t you? No; it&rsquo;s in your pocket&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all right. Thank ye, doctor, you&rsquo;re a good sort, and as quick at a hint as
      any man I&rsquo;ve met.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of months after narrating his experiences, Wolf Tone Maloney
      finished his term, and was released. For a long time I neither saw him nor
      heard of him, and he had almost slipped from my memory, until I was
      reminded, in a somewhat tragic manner, of his existence. I had been
      attending a patient some distance off in the country, and was riding back,
      guiding my tired horse among the boulders which strewed the pathway, and
      endeavoring to see my way through the gathering darkness, when I came
      suddenly upon a little wayside inn. As I walked my horse up toward the
      door, intending to make sure of my bearings before proceeding further, I
      heard the sound of a violent altercation within the little bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be a chorus of expostulation or remonstrance, above which
      two powerful voices rang out loud and angry. As I listened, there was a
      momentary hush, two pistol shots sounded almost simultaneously, and with a
      crash the door burst open and a pair of dark figures staggered out into
      the moonlight. They struggled for a moment in a deadly wrestle, and then
      went down together among the loose stones. I had sprung off my horse, and,
      with the help of half a dozen rough fellows from the bar, dragged them
      away from one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glance was sufficient to convince me that one of them was dying fast. He
      was a thick-set burly fellow, with a determined cast of countenance. The
      blood was welling from a deep stab in his throat, and it was evident that
      an important artery had been divided. I turned away from him in despair,
      and walked over to where his antagonist was lying. He was shot through the
      lungs, but managed to raise himself up on his hand as I approached, and
      peered anxiously up into my face. To my surprise, I saw before me the
      haggard features and flaxen hair of my prison acquaintance, Maloney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, doctor!&rdquo; he said, recognizing me. &ldquo;How is he? Will he die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked the question so earnestly that I imagined he had softened at the
      last moment, and feared to leave the world with another homicide upon his
      conscience. Truth, however, compelled me to shake my head mournfully, and
      to intimate that the wound would prove a mortal one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maloney gave a wild cry of triumph, which brought the blood welling out
      from between his lips. &ldquo;Here, boys,&rdquo; he gasped to the little group around
      him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s money in my inside pocket. Damn the expense! Drinks round.
      There&rsquo;s nothing mean about me. I&rsquo;d drink with you, but I&rsquo;m going. Give the
      doc my share, for he&rsquo;s as good&mdash;&rdquo; Here his head fell back with a
      thud, his eye glazed, and the soul of Wolf Tone Maloney, forger, convict,
      ranger, murderer, and government peach, drifted away into the Great
      Unknown.

      I cannot conclude without borrowing the account of the fatal quarrel which
      appeared in the column of the <i>West Australian Sentinel</i>. The curious
      will find it in the issue of October 4,1881:

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Fatal Affray.&mdash;W. T. Maloney, a well-know citizen of New
     Montrose, and proprietor of the Yellow Boy gambling saloon,
     has met with his death under rather painful circumstances.
     Mr. Maloney was a man who had led a checkered existence, and
     whose past history is replete with interest. Some of our
     readers may recall the Lena Valley murders, in which he
     figured as the principal criminal. It is conjectured that
     during the seven months that he owned a bar in that region,
     from twenty to thirty travelers were hocussed and made away
     with.   He succeeded, however, in evading the vigilance of
     the officers of the law, and allied himself with the
     bushrangers of Bluemansdyke, whose heroic capture and
     subsequent execution are matters of history. Maloney
     extricated himself from the fate which awaited him by
     turning Queen&rsquo;s evidence. He afterward visited Europe, but
     returned to West Australia, where he has long played a
     prominent part in local matters. On Friday evening he
     encountered an old enemy, Thomas Grimthorpe, commonly known
     as Tattooed Tom, of Hawkesbury.

     &ldquo;Shots were exchanged, and both were badly wounded, only
     surviving a few minutes. Mr. Maloney had the reputation of
     being not only the most wholesale murderer that ever lived,
     but also of having a finish and attention to detail in
     matters of evidence which has been unapproached by any
     European criminal. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi!</i>&rdquo;
